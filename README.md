Grand Circus week 2 assessment.

Build rules were to make login form that matched wireframe provided. On submission, form was to validate a given email and password. 
If matched, page was to open a welcome screen for the name of the user. If no match, form was to display error message. 

Additional functionality was added by me to make 'Recover Password' and 'Go Back' buttons function and redirect to the necessary screens.

Although if you simply inspected the js file you'd see that anyway. Haven't gotten to any backend yet!

Project was completed in 1.5 hours.
